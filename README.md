# VBA---Challenge
Module 2 challenge 

In this assignmnet I was taksed with sorting information across multiple excel spread sheets and organize it grouped in to different catagories.
Tasks included 
 - Loop through all "ticker" values and find their total stock volume traded and assign both the ticker and the corrosponding stock value.
 - Next we had to find the quarterly chang in price and display the change in price from opeing to closing on that stock.
 - We then had to asertain the percentage of change that the stock saw from the stock opening to closing.
 - Lastly we needed to loop through the data again to find the stock which saw the largest percentage increase in total volume and the lowest.
     - Included was finding the stock with the lragest total volume.
